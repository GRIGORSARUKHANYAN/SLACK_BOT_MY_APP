# SLACK-BOT
welcome to my slack_bot app!
The purpose of the bot is to provide an opportunity to write a letter in several channels at the same time.
We have certain rules that must be followed.
We start with the /massage command, after which we put the # sign and the names of the channel/channels we want to write, note that the channel name written with a separate # n sign will be simply ignored, a reminder, be careful not to import channel names where you do not have permission. otherwise, the step will be canceled and you will receive a warning email from our bot application.
note that if you specify several channels, at least one of which is not valid, that case also leads to a warning letter.
mandatory condition! be sure to put the / sign next to channels and mail
for example
/massage #general #random /your massage:
Thank you
